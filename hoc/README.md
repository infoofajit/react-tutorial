# Getting Started with HOC componet

## Higher Order Components or HOC are basically functions that take a component as an argument and return a new component.

## Higher Order Components are useful to abstract a shared logic used by many components.

## Components in React allow code reuse and prevent code repetition. But when you develop a React application it is not always straightforward to apply the DRY principles and you have to write repeated code in multiple components. But by using HOCs you can reduce the repeated code, by encapsulating that logic into a Higher Order Component. We will look at some examples and patterns below.
